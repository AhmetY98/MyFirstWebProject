I started doing researches about what kind of images I could use and where can I find a credible history of Istanbul

For navbar I preferred horizontal navbar that chances color when hovered and indicates the active page by a different color


Then I started with my index page which is simple web page that has a video background that takes a tour of Istanbul. I added a button that directs you to the second page
After that, I designed the second page to mention the short history of istanbul that is centrallized and has animation of images.

I also added navigation bar.For navbar I preferred horizontal navbar that chances color when hovered and indicates the active page by a different color For this I checked samples from w3schools to see what kind of navigation bars are available. By getting help from there I created a navbar that is good for me

for the animations I checked our old labs and exercises and animated images.

To set up my page design on mobile devices I added media css style to make sure that my website will fit the mobile devices better.


I added footers that we learned at our class exercise to add more design

For the last page I wanted to include a survey and used jquery to check the details that are entered.

Also I included references page to credit the sources that I have used.
