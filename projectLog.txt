All the files have CSS included in the code as well as the scripts.

I started doing research about what kind of images I could use and where I find a credible history of Istanbul

For the navbar, I preferred a horizontal navbar that changes colour when hovered and indicates the active page by a different colour


Then I started with my index page, which is a simple web page that has a video background that takes a tour of Istanbul. I added a button that directs you to the second page
After that, I designed the second page to mention the short history of Istanbul, which is centralized and has an animation of images.

I also added a navigation bar. For navbar I preferred horizontal navbar that chances color when hovered and indicates the active page by a different color For this I checked samples from w3schools to see what kind of navigation bars are available. By getting help from there, I created a navbar that is good for me

for the animations, I checked our old labs and exercises and animated images.

To set up my page design on mobile devices, I added media CSS style to make sure that my website would fit the mobile devices better.


I added footers that we learned in our class exercise to add more design

For the last page, I wanted to include a survey and used jQuery to check the details that were entered.

Also, I included a references page to credit the sources that I have used.
